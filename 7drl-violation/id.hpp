// One id is attached to you

// Every time in a public place when someone ask you for your id
// your phone can hide your original ID and show a fake one
// If you get caught and PO brings you to the station the phone won't help
// you and it's game over
//
// You use your ID to pay for stuff. Every citizen is allowed to borrow money
// (means his balance can go below zero). But your fake IDs aren't good ones
// so for you borrowing money is a law violation
// To check your balance shop will need 1-2 hours, so after that if you had no
// money they'll call police at that place
